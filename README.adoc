= pewee: Pack required DLLs into wheels

When building packages with native extensions, native libraries are not included in the wheel.
To fix this problem, we need to put them in ourselves.

There's https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel[*auditwheel*] for Linux and
https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate[*delocate*] for macOS,
so here's one for Windows.

How *pewee* works: it unpacks a Windows wheel, goes over those, find DLLs they require,
copy them into the wheel, and repack it.

== Install
